title: Clear the content of the editor
description: Explanation on how to remove all content of the editor
---

Sometimes you want to programmatically remove all content from the editor in order to start from a blank editor.

The first thing to do is to get a reference to the `Editor`. This is explained on [Get Editor reference](get-reference-to-editor).

This example will create a ClearButton that clears the content of the `Editor`. We will assume that you chose to get the reference to the `Editor` via the `getEditor` API.

:::caution
Let's repeat here that this `getEditor` API only works within the `Composer` context and `getEditor` call can only be made during component initialization.
:::

``` diff lang="svelte"
// ClearButton.svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { getEditor } from 'svelte-lexical';
	const editor = getEditor();
</script>

<button>
	Clear the content
</button>
```

Now we want to call a function that will clear the content when the button is clicked. For this, we need to add an onclick listener on the button and then use the `editor.update(..)` API to give lexical a callback that it will call in a next update cycle to update the state of the editor.

``` diff lang="svelte"
// ClearButton.svelte
<script lang="ts">
        import { getEditor } from 'svelte-lexical';
        const editor = getEditor();
+        function clearContent() {
+          // code to be added here
+        }
</script>

-<button>
+<button on:click={() => editor.update(clearContent)}>
        Clear the content
</button>
```

When `editor.update(..)` is called, the given callback has to build a new editor state and for this, we need to use the corresponding APIs.
In order to clear the content, one way is to call `.clear()` on the `RootNode` of the content. So we need to first add a method that will give us access to the root node :

``` diff lang="svelte"
// ClearButton.svelte
<script lang="ts">
-        import { getEditor } from 'svelte-lexical';
+        import { getEditor, $getRoot as getRoot } from 'svelte-lexical';
        const editor = getEditor();
        function clearContent() {
          // code to be added here
        }
</script>

<button on:click={() => editor.update(clearContent)}>
        Clear the content
</button>
```

:::caution
Note how `$getRoot` was renamed to `getRoot` during the import. This is necessary in order to not confuse `Svelte` as `$` is part of the `Svelte` semantics and `Svelte` will refuse to expose a function that starts with a `$`
:::

Next, in order to finalize the `ClearButton` component, we have to fill the `clearContent` method with the necessary call to `root.clear()`.

``` diff lang="svelte"
// ClearButton.svelte
<script lang="ts">
        import { getEditor, $getRoot as getRoot } from 'svelte-lexical';
        const editor = getEditor();
        function clearContent() {
-          // code to be added here
+          const root = getRoot();
+          root.clear();
        }
</script>

<button on:click={() => editor.update(clearContent)}>
        Clear the content
</button>
```

The `ClearButton` is now in its final state. Letâ€™s add the button to MyEditor.svelte

``` diff lang="svelte"
// MyEditor.svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import {
		Composer, ContentEditable, getEditor,
		HorizontalRuleNode, HorizontalRulePlugin, RichTextPlugin
	} from 'svelte-lexical';
	import { theme } from 'svelte-lexical/dist/themes/default';
	import MyToolbar from './MyToolbar.svelte';
+	import ClearButton from './ClearButton.svelte';

	const initialConfig = {
		theme: theme,
		namespace: 'pg_demo',
		nodes: [HorizontalRuleNode],
		onError: (error: Error) => {
			throw error;
		}
	};
</script>

<Composer {initialConfig}>
	<div class="editor-shell svelte-lexical">
		<MyToolbar />
+		<ClearButton/>
		<div class="editor-container">
			<div class="editor-scroller">
				<div class="editor">
					<ContentEditable />
				</div>
			</div>
			<RichTextPlugin />
			<HorizontalRulePlugin />
		</div>
	</div>
</Composer>
```


As a pure educational scenario, and in order to show you that there is a lot more than `.clear()` in the lexical/svelte-lexical API, here is another version of the `ClearButton`: instead of calling `.clear()`, we select all the nodes under the root node of the `Editor` - just like a user would select all the text inside the editor - and then remove the selection.

Here is the modified version of the `ClearButton` button :

``` diff lang="svelte"
// ClearButton.svelte
<script lang="ts">
        import { getEditor, $getRoot as getRoot } from 'svelte-lexical';
        const editor = getEditor();
        function clearContent() {
          const root = getRoot();
-          root.clear();
+          const selection = root.select(0, root.getChildrenSize());
+          selection.removeText();
        }
</script>

<button on:click={() => editor.update(clearContent)}>
        Clear the content
</button>
```


If you are interested in the available APIs on the root node, you can check
- the available methods on the `RootNote` class in the lexical API ([Lexical RootNode API](https://lexical.dev/docs/api/classes/lexical.RootNode))
- and since `RootNode` inherits from `ElementNode`, the available methods on the `ElementNote` class in the lexical API ([Lexical ElementNode API](https://lexical.dev/docs/api/classes/lexical.ElementNode))

For information, the `.clear()` method that we used earlier is defined by the `ElementNode` class.
